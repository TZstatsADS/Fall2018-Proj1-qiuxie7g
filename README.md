### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2018

+ Projec title: Happy Moments Analysis Report
+ This project is conducted by Han Gao

+ Project summary: In this study, we got some results that are consistent with our common sense, like baseball is the most popular sports and dogs bring more happiness than cats. Another touching result is that we found the young generation focuses more on their own, but most of the old people's happiness comes from their partners and children. We also got some results that are surprising and amazing, like we can predict a person's marriage status with a 70% accurate rate by analyzing his/her words of describbing happy moments, which seems impossible.
